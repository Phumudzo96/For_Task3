# For_Task3

The activities in this task are all different and are designed to test your
knowledge of loops.

Create a while loop that will display count down f rom 20 to 0.

Next, create a loop that will display all the even numbers between 1 and
20.

Now, create a loop that will produce the following output:

      *

      **

      ***
      
      ****
      
      *****

Finally, write the code to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD, or
highest common factor) of two positive integers.
